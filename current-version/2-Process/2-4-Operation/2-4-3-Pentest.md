### Penetration Test

A penetration test, or pen test, is a simulated attack on systems and applications to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. It involves attempting to breach web and mobile applications, APIs, network devices, workstations, servers, and more, uncovering issues like SQL injection, code injection, XSS, and privilege escalation.

While penetration testers use automated tools for scanning and information gathering, most testing is conducted manually. Manual testing is crucial for detecting vulnerabilities related to business logic and other issues that automated scans might miss.

### Approaches

A penetration test can be approached in three ways: black-box, gray-box, or white-box.

- **Black-box:** Testers have no prior information about the application, except possibly an IP address or domain.
- **Gray-box:** Testers are given additional information, such as credentials for test accounts. This approach balances cost and effectiveness, providing deeper insights without the high expense of white-box testing. It should be the preferred approach most of the time.
- **White-box:** Testers have full access to all available information, including the application's source code.

### Process Overview

#### Planning
Planning is crucial in the penetration testing process. A well-planned test maximizes results and minimizes potential failures. Key elements include:

1. **Assembling the team:** the composition of the penetration testing team is very important. It can either consist of internal cybersecurity professionals who understand the organization's systems and policies intimately or an external team hired for their specialized skills and objectivity, which can bring fresh perspectives and expertise in identifying vulnerabilities that internal teams might overlook.
2. Defining a scope:
3. Defining an approach:
4. Requirements:
5. Dates and deadlines:

#### Execution


#### Reporting


### Tools
There are several tools that can help while performing penetration test against applications. The most common are:
- [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) - a comprehensive software tool used for web application security testing. Key features include a proxy for intercepting and modifying web traffic, a scanner for automated vulnerability detection, and tools for performing manual testing, such as repeater, intruder, and so forth.
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org) - an open-source tool similar to BurpSuite.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - ests API security by sending various HTTP requests, manipulating headers, and automating tests. It helps identify vulnerabilities like authentication issues and data exposure, integrating with other security tools for comprehensive analysis.
- [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) -
